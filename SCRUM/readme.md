<h4>  What is SCRUM </h4>

Scrum is a lightweight framework. It consists of roles, events & artifacts & can employ various processes and techniques. 

> Another way of seeing it: At the end of the day, it's a framework that is an empirical approach for managing work and navigating complexity.

With SCRUM, The project team consists of a small team of people that is highly flexible & adaptable.

SCRUM is an agile framework, since it's adaptive instead of predictive.

Scrum is based on empirical process control.
Empirical Process has 3 pillars (to make good observations)L

```
	Transparent
		Scrumts events & artifacts should be visible to all those involved
	Inspective
		Frequently inspect scrum artifacts & progress towards sprint goal to detect undesirable variances
	Adaptation
		During inspections, if anything is incorrect/insufficient, process, plans or product are to be adapted.
		Think: Valid product vs product valid
```

```
Scrum works best when people follow these 5 Values (FROCC):
	Focus
	Respect
	Openness
	Commitment
	Courage
```

### <p align="center" id = "scrumTeam"> "Meet the Scrum Team" | [Back to ToC](#toc) </p>

Scrum Teams are
  - small group of people (typically 10 or fewer)   
  - cross-functional, meaning the members have all the skills necessary to create value each Sprint. 
  E.G. Research, Sales, & Marketing are all apart of the team.
  - self-managing, meaning they internally decide who does what, when, and how.
  Note: NOT directed by others outside the team. The team has ALL THE POWER
  - The entire Scrum Team share collective responsibility.
  - Scrum manager manages the process, not the people!!

The team model in Scrum is designed to optimize flexibility, creativity, and productivity.

The entire Scrum Team is accountable for creating a valuable, useful Increment every Sprint. 
The Scrum Team handles all tasks related to the product from start to finish including: stakeholder collaboration, verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, and anything else that might be required.

Scrum defines 3 Roles within the Scrum Team (typical size for scrum team is 10 or less):

    the Developers, the Product Owner, and the Scrum Master.

Product Owner
  - maximizes value of product and the work the Scrum team does.
  - monitors progress towards high level goals
  - manages work via product backlog
  - focuses on priority, clarity & transparancy of items
  - Only Product Owner has authority to cancel sprint.
  - If you want to change the Product Backlog, you'll need to charm or bake cookies for the Product Owner :-)


In an Agile environment, Product Owner decides to release an increment when an iteration is complete.

> Q: Who should know the most about the progress toward a business objective or a release, and be able to explain the alternatives most clearly?
> Answer: Product Owner!

Development Team
  - Build the actual product increment
  - cross functional & self organizing
  - Less than 10 members
  - adheres to the "Definition of Done"
  - Can include the Product Owner and Scrum Master but it's not ideal as it may cause a conflict of interest.
  - Developers should have all the skills needed to turn selected backlog items into a Product Increment.
	
  The entire scrum team is accountable for creating value every sprint. Scrum recognizes no titles for Development Team members, regardless of the work being performed by the person.

Scrum Master
  - act as guide on Scrum Theory, practices & rules
  - applies SCRUM correctly
  - The Scrum Master ensures that the Developers have the DAILY SCRUM, 
		but the Developers are responsible for conducting the Daily Scrum. 
  - The Scrum Master teaches the Developers to keep the Daily Scrum within the 15-minute timebox.

The Sprint is the heartbeat of Scrum during which a usable and potentially releasable Product Increment is created, similar to that of a short project.

The Sprint is a container for all other events.
Sprints are intentionally short - Maximum sprint length is 1 calendar month
		
For each sprint, the Scrum Team comes together in 3 parts:
  - the Sprint Planning meeting: 
  	The team assesses which items from top of Product Backlog they can pull into sprint.
  - The team will then work on the sprint, hold daily standups, and, when the sprint is complete, deliver a releasable product increment e.g. getting approval to push to master.
  -  the Sprint Review meeting occurs at the end that evaluates the work completed.
	IDEALLY, NO NEW WORK IS PUSHED

Various practices exist to forecast progress, like burn-downs, burn-ups, or cumulative flows.



Sprint Planning Meeting
  - first event within the sprint
  - the collaborative work of ENTIRE scrum team.
  - Sprint Planning is timeboxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. 
	- For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.

  - Sprint goal is defined. Explains the plan of work for the Sprint and why the work of that Sprint is important.
  - i.e. After the Development Team forecasts the Product Backlog items it will deliver in the Sprint, the Scrum Team crafts a Sprint Goal.
	- During Sprint Planning, the Development Team may also invite other people to attend in order to provide technical or domain advice.

	```
	Sprint Goal
		- high level objective that will be accomplished by completing the Product Backlog items 
		- helps ensure a shared understanding of the whole Sprint purpose (puts everything on the table)
		- Once settled, THE SPRINT GOAL IDEALLY SHOULD NEVER CHANGE (except by Product Owner). The scope however may be clarified/renogitioted.
	```

	Questions to ask:
  	- what can be delivered? 
  	- how can it be delivered? 
  	- Why is the sprint valuable?

	INPUT for Sprint Planning:
	  - the Product Backlog, 
	  - the latest product Increment, 
	  - projected capacity of the Development Team during the Sprint, 
	  - and past performance of the Development Team.

	Primary output for Sprint Planning: The Sprint backlog!
		- Sprint backlog is what & how;
		 		
  > "The Sprint Goal, the Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus the plan for delivering them are together referred to as the Sprint Backlog." - Scrum Guide

  	The more the Developers know about their past performance, their upcoming capacity, and their Definition of Done, 
		the more confident they will be in their Sprint forecasts.


	
SCRUM Daily Standup
	- At max 15 min standup.		
	The Daily Scrum is an internal meeting for the DEVELOPMENT TEAM!
			If others are present, the Scrum Master ensures that they do not disrupt the meeting.

	Think:
	  - What did I do yesterday?
	  - What will I do today?
	  - Do I see any stucks or impediments?

> Note: THERE IS NO PRESCRIBED STRUCTURE!  



Sprint Review Meeting
  - Is the second to last event of the Sprint and is timeboxed to a maximum of four hours for a one-month Sprint. 
  - For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.
  - Inspects the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations
  - the Scrum Team and stakeholders review what was accomplished in the Sprint and what has changed in their environment

> Note: The Key Stakeholders are allowed to participate only in the Sprint Review meeting. However, any member of the Scrum Team can interact with them any time.

```
Output/Result:
	Revised Product Backlog 
	[that defines the probable Product Backlog items for the next Sprint]
```



The Sprint Retrospective 
  - concludes the Sprint. 
  - similar to Lessons Learned; it's an opportunity for Scrum team to inspect itself & create improvement plans for next Sprint.
  - SPRINT RETROSPECTIVE IS INTERNAL ONLY FOR SCRUM TEAM	since it identifies the most helpful changes to improve its effectiveness such as:
	- how'd the last sprint go
	- potential improvements & improvement plan 
  - Timeboxed to a maximum of three hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.
 
  - To recap, the purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to:

	- Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools;
	- Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements; and,
	- Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team does its work.

Definition of Done can be reviewed and adapted during each Sprint Retrospective e.g. there should be more emphasis on unit testing

Before talking about Sprint Artifacts, here are a few FAQ's:
	
	> When does a Sprint conclude?
	When the sprint retrospective is complete.

  During the Sprint:
  - No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal;
  - Quality goals do not decrease; and,
  - Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team as more is learned

	> What happens when a Sprint is cancelled?
		If the sprint goal becomes obsolete, then sprint can be cancelled.

		When a Sprint is cancelled, any completed and “Done” Product Backlog items are reviewed. 
		If part of the work is potentially releasable, the Product Owner typically accepts it. 
		All incomplete Product Backlog Items are re-estimated and put back on the Product Backlog.

		If some work could not be done by end of Sprint, the Sprint Backlog should be re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team.

	> WHO HAS AUTHORITY TO CANCEL THE SPRINT?
			Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint

### <p align="center" id = "artifacts"> "The Scrum Artifact—where love and hate coexist beautifully." | [Back to ToC](#toc) </p>

Artifacts are key tools or important things we create to solve a problem. 

Artifacts maximize transparency & shared understanding of work.
  - both backlogs demonstrate work to be done that will define value

> Who's responsible for coping with incomplete artifact transparency? <br/></br>
The Scrum Master’s job is to work with the Scrum Team and the organization to increase the transparency of the artifacts. 
This work usually involves learning, convincing, and change.

Product Backlog
  - an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product
  - Typically each Product Backlog Item has a description, estimate & value.
  - Product Owner is SOLE person responsible
  - is dynamic and is never complete. As long as product exists, the Product Backlog also exists so constant refinement is needed.
  - Sorted by WHATEVER IS DEEMED MOST APPROPRIATE BY THE PRODUCT OWNER (since stakeholders have unlimited needs). 
	- Typically, most valuable & clear items should be placed on top.
	- Products have one Product Backlog, regardless of how many Scrum Teams are used.

	```	
	Key Notes:
		- list of requirements that product team has to work on
		- dyanamic list - the backlog evolves over time
		- higher priority items are on top of the list
	```
	
	> The Product Backlog emerges to define “what” will fulfill the Product Goal.
	  - The Product Goal describes a future state of the product & is the long-term objective for the Scrum Team
	  - throughout sprint, can be refined by adding descriptions, estimates & order.
		

	> Who is responsible for all estimates in the Product Backlog? <br/> </br>
		The Development Team is responsible for all estimates in the Product Backlog. 
		The Product Owner may influence the Development Team by helping it understand and select trade-offs, but the people who will perform the work make the final estimate.

		Product Backlog management includes:
		  - Clearly expressing Product Backlog items;
		  - Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions;
		  - Optimizing the value of the work the Development Team performs;
		  - Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the Scrum Team will work on next; and,
		  - Ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level needed.
		
		

Sprint Backlog
  - Development teams plan on HOW they'll deliver the new product increment and achieve the Sprint Goal.
  - Owned and managed by the Development Team.
  - The Product Backlog items selected for this Sprint plus the plan for delivering them; ie it is a subset of the Product Backlog chosen for a specific Sprint.
  - The Developers modify the Sprint Backlog throughout the Sprint, and the Sprint Backlog emerges during the Sprint.
		
	Remember: 	
	- This backlog is the what & how of the sprint
	- During sprint planning, scrum team creates sprint goal & sprint backlog. So it's created during sprint plannning by & for DEVELOPMENT team.
	- pull in items from product backlog for that sprint
	- completes Sprint Goal
		- sometimes helps team plan in advance for next Sprint Planning. i.e. "What to work on next?" 
	- their plan on how to deliver the sprint goal
	- regularly updated during sprint. IT REGURLARLY CHANGES.
		
	> The Sprint Goal, the Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, 
		plus the plan for delivering them are together referred to as the Sprint Backlog.

		[REPEAT] After the Development Team forecasts the Product Backlog items it will deliver in the Sprint, 
			the Scrum Team crafts a Sprint Goal.


Increment
	- working product at the end of a Sprint.
	- created by Development Team
	- sum of all completed Product Backlog items in a given sprint AND values of increments in previous sprints
		- The sum of all Increments form a product.

	- provides transparent "snapshot" of the state of product at end of Sprint
		- "Working software is the primary measure of progess"
	- meets the teams definition of "Done"
		- Increments are usable by stakeholders!

	- the "Done" portion of product completed during a sprint that defines the COMPLETE and valuable work produced by the Developers during a Sprint. 
			
	- Increment should be released to end users when product owners are most comfortable or when they think its the best.

Definition of Done
	- Definition of Done can be reviewed and adapted during each Sprint Retrospective.
	- During each Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team plans ways to increase product quality by adapting the definition of “Done” as appropriate.

	- What to take into account:
		- If the definition of “done” for an increment is part of the conventions, 
			standards or guidelines of the development organization, 
			all Scrum Teams must follow it as a minimum. 

	The development team is responsible for creating "Definition of Done"
		If “done” for an increment is not a convention of the development organization, 
			the Development Team of the Scrum Team must define a definition of “done” appropriate for the product. 
	
		If there are multiple Scrum Teams working on the system or product release, the development teams on all of the Scrum Teams must mutually define the definition of “Done.”

	DoD is used to assess when work is complete on the product Increment
		DoD guides the Development Team in knowing how many Product Backlog items it can select during a Sprint Planning
		DoD ensures artifact transparency

THE END! 

There you have it! You were able to successfully learn SCRUM.
