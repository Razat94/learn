Scrum is a lightweight framework. It consists of roles, events & artifacts & employs various processes and techniques. 

> Another way of seeing it: At the end of the day, it's a framework 
that is an empirical approach for managing work and navigating complexity.

With Scrum, The project team consists of a small team of people that is highly flexible & adaptable.

Scrum is an agile framework, as it is adaptive instead of predictive.

Scrum is based on empirical process control, 
which has three pillars for making good observations:


```
	Transparent
		Scrumts events & artifacts should be visible to all those involved
	Inspective
		Frequently inspect scrum artifacts & progress towards sprint goal to detect undesirable variances
	Adaptation
		During inspections, if anything is incorrect/insufficient, process, plans or product are to be adapted.
		Think: Valid product vs product valid
```

```
Scrum works best when people follow these 5 Values (FROCC):
	Focus
	Respect
	Openness
	Commitment
	Courage
```

### <p align="center" id = "scrumTeam"> "Meet the Scrum Team" | [Back to ToC](#toc) </p>

Scrum Teams are:
  - a small group of people (typically 10 or fewer)   
  - cross-functional, meaning the members have all the skills necessary to create value each Sprint. 
  E.G. Research, Sales, & Marketing are all apart of the team.
  - self-managing, meaning they internally decide who does what, when, and how.
  Note: NOT directed by others outside the team. The team has ALL THE POWER
  - The entire Scrum Team share collective responsibility.
  - Scrum manager manages the process, not the people!!

The team model in Scrum is designed to optimize flexibility, creativity, and productivity.

The entire Scrum Team is accountable for creating a valuable, useful Increment every Sprint. 
The Scrum Team handles all tasks related to the product from start to finish including: 
stakeholder collaboration, verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, 
and anything else that might be required.

Scrum defines 3 Roles within the Scrum Team (typical size for scrum team is 10 or less):
    the Developers, the Product Owner, and the Scrum Master.

Product Owner
  - maximizes value of product and the work the Scrum team does.
  - monitors progress towards high level goals
  - manages work via product backlog
  - focuses on priority, clarity & transparancy of items
  - Only Product Owner has authority to cancel sprint.
  - If you want to change the Product Backlog, you'll need to charm or bake cookies for the Product Owner :-)


In an Agile environment, Product Owner decides to release an increment when an iteration is complete.

> Q: Who should know the most about the progress toward a business objective or a release, and can explain the alternatives most clearly?
> Answer: Product Owner!

Development Team
  - Build the actual product increment
  - cross functional & self organizing
  - Less than 10 members
  - adheres to the "Definition of Done"
  - Can include the Product Owner and Scrum Master but it's not ideal as it may cause a conflict of interest.
  - Developers should have all the skills needed to turn selected backlog items into a Product Increment.
	
  The entire scrum team is accountable for creating value every sprint. Scrum recognizes no titles for Development Team members, regardless of the work being performed by the person.

Scrum Master
  - act as guide on Scrum Theory, practices & rules
  - applies SCRUM correctly
  - The Scrum Master ensures that the Developers have the DAILY SCRUM, 
		but the Developers are responsible for conducting the Daily Scrum. 
  - The Scrum Master teaches the Developers to keep the Daily Scrum within the 15-minute timebox.

The Sprint is the heartbeat of Scrum during which a usable and potentially releasable Product Increment is created, 
similar to that of a short project.

The Sprint is a container for all other events.
Sprints are intentionally short - Maximum sprint length is 1 calendar month
		
For each sprint, the Scrum Team comes together in 3 parts:
  - the Sprint Planning meeting: 
  	The team assesses which items from top of Product Backlog they can pull into sprint.
  - The team will then work on the sprint, hold daily standups, and, when the sprint is complete, deliver a releasable product increment e.g. getting approval to push to master.
  -  the Sprint Review meeting occurs at the end that evaluates the work completed.
	IDEALLY, NO NEW WORK IS PUSHED

Various practices exist to forecast progress, like burn-downs, burn-ups, or cumulative flows.



Sprint Planning Meeting
  - first event within the sprint
  - the collaborative work of ENTIRE scrum team.
  - Sprint Planning is timeboxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. 
	- For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.

  - Sprint goal is defined. Explains the plan of work for the Sprint and why the work of that Sprint is important.
  - i.e. After the Development Team forecasts the Product Backlog items it will deliver in the Sprint, 
  the Scrum Team crafts a Sprint Goal.
	- During Sprint Planning, the Development Team may invite other people to attend 
	in order to provide technical or domain advice.

  ```
  Sprint Goal
	- high level objective that will be accomplished by completing the Product Backlog items 
	- helps ensure a shared understanding of the whole Sprint purpose (puts everything on the table)
	- Once settled, THE SPRINT GOAL IDEALLY SHOULD NEVER CHANGE (except by Product Owner). 
	  - The scope however may be clarified/renogitioted.
  ```

	Questions to ask:
  	- what can be delivered? 
  	- how can it be delivered? 
  	- Why is the sprint valuable?

	Input for Sprint Planning:
	  - the Product Backlog, 
	  - the latest product Increment, 
	  - projected capacity of the Development Team during the Sprint, 
	  - and past performance of the Development Team.

	Primary output for Sprint Planning: The Sprint backlog!
		- Sprint backlog is what & how;
		 		
  > "The Sprint Goal, the Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, 
  plus the plan for delivering them are together referred to as the Sprint Backlog." - Scrum Guide

  	The more the Developers know about:
		their past performance, their upcoming capacity, and their Definition of Done, 
	the more confident they will be in their Sprint forecasts.

	[REPEAT] 
	After the Development Team forecasts what it can deliver, the Scrum Team defines a Sprint Goal.

	
Scrum Daily Standup
  - At max 15 min standup.		
  - The Daily Scrum is an internal meeting for the DEVELOPMENT TEAM!
			If others are present, the Scrum Master ensures that they do not disrupt the meeting.

	Think:
	  - What did I do yesterday?
	  - What will I do today?
	  - Do I see any stucks or impediments?

> Note: THERE IS NO PRESCRIBED STRUCTURE!  



Sprint Review Meeting
  - Is the second to last event of the Sprint and is timeboxed to a maximum of four hours for a one-month Sprint. 
  - For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.
  - Inspects the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations
  - the Scrum Team and stakeholders review what was accomplished in the Sprint and what has changed in their environment

> Note: The Key Stakeholders are allowed to participate only in the Sprint Review meeting. However, any member of the Scrum Team can interact with them any time.

```
Output/Result:
	Revised Product Backlog 
	[that defines the probable Product Backlog items for the next Sprint]
```



The Sprint Retrospective 
  - concludes the Sprint. 
  - similar to Lessons Learned; it's an opportunity for Scrum team to inspect itself & create improvement plans for next Sprint.
  - SPRINT RETROSPECTIVE IS INTERNAL ONLY FOR SCRUM TEAM 
  since it identifies the most helpful changes to improve its effectiveness such as:
	- how'd the last sprint go
	- potential improvements & improvement plan 
  - Timeboxed to a maximum of three hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.
 
  - To recap, the purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to:

	- Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools;
	- Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements; and,
	- Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team does its work.

Definition of Done can be reviewed and adapted during each Sprint Retrospective e.g. there should be more emphasis on unit testing

Before talking about Sprint Artifacts, here are a few FAQ's:
	
  > When does a Sprint conclude? <br/>
	When the sprint retrospective is complete.

  > What happens when a Sprint is cancelled? <br/>
		If the sprint goal becomes obsolete, then sprint can be cancelled.

  > WHO HAS AUTHORITY TO CANCEL THE SPRINT? <br/>
		Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint

During the Sprint:
  - No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal;
  - Quality goals do not decrease; and,
  - Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team as more is learned

When a Sprint is cancelled: 
  - any completed and “Done” Product Backlog items are reviewed. 
  - If part of the work is potentially releasable, the Product Owner typically accepts it. 
  - All incomplete Product Backlog Items are re-estimated and put back on the Product Backlog.
	- If some work could not be done by end of Sprint, the Sprint Backlog should be re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team.

### <p align="center" id = "artifacts"> "The Scrum Artifact—where love and hate coexist beautifully." | [Back to ToC](#toc) </p>

Artifacts are key tools or important things we create to solve a problem. 

Artifacts maximize transparency & shared understanding of work.
  - both backlogs demonstrate work to be done that will define value

> Q: Who's responsible for coping with incomplete artifact transparency? <br/></br>
A: The Scrum Master helps the team and organization make artifacts more transparent 
through learning, influencing, and driving change.

Product Backlog
  - an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product
  - Typically each Product Backlog Item has a description, estimate & value.
  - Product Owner is SOLE person responsible
  - is dynamic and requires ongoing refinement for as long as the product exists. 
  - The Development Team is responsible for all estimates in the Product Backlog. 
	- The Product Owner may influence the Development Team by helping it understand and select trade-offs, but the people who will perform the work make the final estimate.
  - Items are sorted by what the Product Owner deems most appropriate (since stakeholders have unlimited needs). 
	- Typically, most valuable & clearly defined items should be placed on top.
	- A product has one Product Backlog, no matter how many Scrum Teams work on it

	```	
	Key Notes:
		- list of requirements that product team has to work on
		- dyanamic list - the backlog evolves over time
		- higher priority items are on top of the list
	```
	
	> The Product Backlog emerges to define “what” will fulfill the Product Goal.
	  - The Product Goal describes a future state of the product & is the long-term objective for the Scrum Team
	  - Throughout sprint, this can be refined by adding descriptions, estimates & order.

	Product Backlog management includes:
	  - Clearly expressing Product Backlog items
	  - Prioritizing items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and objectives.
	  - Maximizing the value of the Development Teams work
	  - Making the Product Backlog visible, transparent, and clear to everyone, showing what the team will work on next
	  - Ensures the Development Team understands items at the necessary level
		
		

Sprint Backlog
  - Development Team plans HOW they'll deliver the new product increment and achieve the Sprint Goal
  - Owned and managed by the Development Team.
  - is a subset of the Product Backlog chosen for a specific Sprint i.e. 
  includes the selected Product Backlog items and the plan to deliver them.
  - The Developers modify the Sprint Backlog throughout the Sprint
  	- It is continuously updated and refined
	- Remember: 	
  		- This backlog represents the "what" and "how" of the Sprint
  		- Created during Sprint Planning along with the sprint goal. It is used by and for the Development Team
  		- Items are pulled from the Product Backlog for that Sprint
  		- The Scrum Team sets the Sprint Goal and builds the Sprint Backlog together
		- Working on sprint backlog guides the team to complete the Sprint Goal
		- May also prepare the team for future Sprints (e.g., “What should we work on next?”)
  	- The plan within the Sprint Backlog is actively maintained and regularly updated during the Sprint
		
  > The Sprint Goal, the Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, 
	plus the plan for delivering them are together referred to as the Sprint Backlog.



Increments:
  - are a working product at the end of a Sprint.
  - created by the Development Team
  - The "Done" part of the product that is complete and valuable.
  - includes all Product Backlog items finished in the Sprint plus value from previous Increments.
	- The sum of all Increments form a product.
  - provides transparent "snapshot" of the state of product at end of Sprint
  	- "concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal."
	- "Working software is the primary measure of progess"
  - meets the teams definition of "Done" and are usable by stakeholders!
  - Can be released to end users when the Product Owner feels it’s the right time.

Definition of Done
  - Can be reviewed and adapted during each Sprint Retrospective.
  - The development team defines what DoD e.g. "Done" means for an increment.
  - If there are multiple Scrum Teams working on the system or product release, the development teams on all of the Scrum Teams must mutually define the definition of “Done.”
  - DoD is used to assess when work is complete on the product Increment by ensuring artifact transparency.
	- DoD guides the Development Team in knowing how many Product Backlog items it can select during a Sprint Planning
	
THE END! 
There you have it! You were able to successfully learn Scrum.
