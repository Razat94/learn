	- Cost Managemet -
	The TCO Calculator helps you estimate the cost savings over time of operating a solution in Azure compared to operating in an on-premises datacenter.
	You need to compare the costs of running an application in an on-premises datacenter with the costs of running the application in Azure.

	- Governance and compliance -

	- Deploying Azure resources - 

	- monitoring tools in Azure -



Event grid
	Event Grid sits in the middle, routing events between them


A file is uploaded to Azure Blob Storage
 -> Blob Storage publishes an event to Event Grid
 -> Event Grid sends the event to:
	- An Azure Function (to process the file)
	- A Logic App (to notify a user)

azure functions - automation at minimum expense
	great for hosting code as part of a services infrastructe
	great for runnings small, event driven or short-running scripts.
Yes — Azure App Service does allow encryption.

Power Automate and Logic Apps automate workflows, but
Azure Automation automates infrastructure tasks.



Azure Cloud Shell is an interactive, browser-accessible shell for managing Azure resources.


Which two protocols can be used to access Azure file shares?
SMB & NFS




You plan to build a new solution in Azure that will use platform as a service (PaaS) products.

What should you use to estimate the monthly costs?

Select only one answer.

- Azure Advisor
- Azure Cost Management
- Azure Pricing calculator
This answer is correct.
- Total Cost of Ownership (TOC) Calculator

The Azure Pricing calculator allows you to estimate and configure according to your specific requirements. You will then receive a consolidated estimated price and a detailed breakdown of the costs associated with each resource you added to your solution.

Resource tags can be used to group billing data and categorize costs by runtime environment, such as billing usage for virtual machines running in a production environment.
Region pairs allow the replication of Azure resources across GEOGRAPHIES to help ensure that a secondary region is available in case of any disaster at the primary region.
In a region pair, a region is paired with another region in the same [geography].
Azure Monitor is a platform that collects metric and logging data, such as CPU percentages. The data can be used to TRIGGER autoscaling.

azure app service = web apps
ExpressRoute = Private Connection



---------------------------------
Azure RBAC allows you to assign a set of permissions to a user or group. 
Resource tags (keyword) are used to locate and act on resources associated with specific workloads, environments, business units, and owners. 
Resource locks prevent the accidental change or deletion of a resource. 
Key Vault is a centralized cloud service for storing an application secrets in a single, central location.

You can use tags to categorize costs by department, such as human resources, marketing, or finance, or by environment, such as test or production.
Which are two common scenarios for using resource tags? 





ARM Templates:
	used to describe the resources you want to use in a declarative JSON format.
	to define the resources you want to provision in a declarative JSON format?

ARM templates are just JSON files that tell Azure what resources to create.
	- it ensures that deployments are the same for each development

Please don't confuse with Azure Resource Manager (ARM): 
[Answer choice] is the deployment and management service for Azure.
	ARM deployment and management service for Azure.




Azure Monitor is a platform that collects metric and logging data, such as CPU percentages. The data can be used to trigger autoscaling.
Azure Container Instances (ACI) is specifically for running containers in Azure.
	You give ACI a container image (your app + everything it needs)
	You specify CPU, memory, and environment
	Azure runs it without you having to manage servers or clusters




	3 separate processes running, one on each VM.
	
	They are independent: one VM crashing doesn’t stop the others.
	They are identical in behavior: same app code, same configuration.

		Together, they handle more users or requests than a single process could.


	You have a web app VMSS with 3 VMs.



Each VM runs a web server process.

Traffic is distributed by a load balancer:

VM1 handles some users

VM2 handles others

VM3 handles others



Each VM in a scale set is a separate machine.

Your app runs on all of them independently.

Each VM runs its own copy of the process, but all copies are identical in code and configuration.




A VM Scale Set can create one or many VMs

You define a minimum number of VMs to start with.
	Azure can automatically add more VMs if demand goes up (scale out).
	Azure can remove VMs if demand drops (scale in


Azure Kubernetes = Azure App Insights for monitoring health

CLUSTER = Monitor



To which object or level is an Azure role-based access control (RBAC) role applied?
scope


Azure Monitor= VMs top running, service failures





Azure Policy is a service in Azure that enables you to create, assign, and manage policies that control or audit resources.

Azure Policy - a service in Azure that enables you to create, assign, and manage policies that CONTROL or audit resources.
		Q: What is used to restrict the deployment of a virtual machine to a specific location?
			Azure Policy

		Azure Monitor is a platform that collects metric and logging data, such as CPU percentages. The data can be used to trigger autoscaling.
			 platform that collects metric and logging data

			Which Azure service can generate an alert if virtual machine utilization is over 80% for five minutes?
			AZURE MONITOR
			Azure Monitor is a platform for collecting, analyzing, visualizing, and alerting based on metrics
