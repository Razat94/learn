- Azure Storage Services -



	Which storage service should you use to store thousands of files containing text and images'
Storage Type?
Azure Blob storage - text/binary data 
Azure Disk Storage provides disks for Azure virtual machines. 
Azure Files supports mounting file storage shares via the Server Message Block Protocal (SMB).
	Azure Files offers fully managed file shares in the cloud that are accessible via industry-standard SMB and NFS protocols.
Azure Queue storage - storing large number of messages (e.g. HTTP or HTTPS calls)
	

Table storage = NOSQL DATA 
	SCHEMALESS  

What are storage tiers?

Storage tiers let you choose how often your data is accessed, so you can balance cost vs speed.

👉 More access = higher cost
👉 Less access = lower cost


Which Azure Blob storage service tier has the highest storage costs and the fastest access times for reading and writing data?
The Hot tier is optimized for storing data that is accessed frequently.






AZURE DATA STORAGE TIER

Which storage tier in Azure Storage delivers the highest
cost of data?
HOT

LOWEST cost of data?
ARchive

Event grid
	Event Grid sits in the middle, routing events between them


A file is uploaded to Azure Blob Storage
 -> Blob Storage publishes an event to Event Grid
 -> Event Grid sends the event to:
	- An Azure Function (to process the file)
	- A Logic App (to notify a user)

azure functions - automation at minimum expense
	great for hosting code as part of a services infrastructe
	great for runnings small, event driven or short-running scripts.
Yes — Azure App Service does allow encryption.

Power Automate and Logic Apps automate workflows, but
Azure Automation automates infrastructure tasks.



Azure Cloud Shell is an interactive, browser-accessible shell for managing Azure resources.





Azure Files = backend file server
		like a folder, but specifically for applications. 


Which two protocols can be used to access Azure file shares?
SMB & NFS








All Azure VMs have an OS disk

That OS disk is Azure Disk Storage

Without it, the VM cannot boot

Each VM has:

OS Disk → Windows or Linux (required)

Data Disks → optional, for apps/data

Both are Azure Disk Storage.

No disk = no VM.

Very simple example of conditional access

Employee signs in from the office → Allowed

Same employee signs in from a new country → Require MFA


how and if a user can sign in, based on certain conditions.


When someone tries to sign in, Azure can look at:

Who the user is (user/group)

What they’re trying to access (app/resource)

Where they’re signing in from (location)

What device they’re using

Risk level (suspicious sign-in or not)

---



Conditional Access can use signals to determine information about authentication attempts, 
and then determine whether to block access or require additional verifications, such as MFA.

What can you use to allow a user to manage all the resources in a resource group?
	Azure role-based access control (RBAC)





You plan to build a new solution in Azure that will use platform as a service (PaaS) products.

What should you use to estimate the monthly costs?

Select only one answer.

- Azure Advisor
- Azure Cost Management
- Azure Pricing calculator
This answer is correct.
- Total Cost of Ownership (TOC) Calculator

The Azure Pricing calculator allows you to estimate and configure according to your specific requirements. You will then receive a consolidated estimated price and a detailed breakdown of the costs associated with each resource you added to your solution.
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/


Resource tags can be used to group billing data and categorize costs by runtime environment, such as billing usage for virtual machines running in a production environment.
Region pairs allow the replication of Azure resources across GEOGRAPHIES to help ensure that a secondary region is available in case of any disaster at the primary region.
In a region pair, a region is paired with another region in the same [geography].
Azure Monitor is a platform that collects metric and logging data, such as CPU percentages. The data can be used to TRIGGER autoscaling.

Containers (AKS / Container Apps)




Azure RBAC allows you to assign a set of permissions to a user or group. 
Resource tags (keyword) are used to locate and act on resources associated with specific workloads, environments, business units, and owners. 
Resource locks prevent the accidental change or deletion of a resource. 
Key Vault is a centralized cloud service for storing an application secrets in a single, central location.

Azure Functions = Serverless computing



You can use tags to categorize costs by department, such as human resources, marketing, or finance, or by environment, such as test or production.

Defense in Depth
- several layers of protection to prevent information from being accessed by unauthorized users

A defense in depth strategy uses a series of mechanisms to slow the advancement of an attack that aims to gain unauthorized access to data

 The principle of least privilege means restricting access to information to only the level that users need to perform their work. 


A DDoS attack attempts to overwhelm and exhaust an application's resources.

The perimeter layer is about protecting an organization's resources from network-based attacks. 



ARM Templates:
	used to describe the resources you want to use in a declarative JSON format.
	to define the resources you want to provision in a declarative JSON format?

ARM templates are just JSON files that tell Azure what resources to create.
	- it ensures that deployments are the same for each development

Please don't confuse with Azure Resource Manager (ARM): 
[Answer choice] is the deployment and management service for Azure.

Azure Monitor is a platform that collects metric and logging data, such as CPU percentages. The data can be used to trigger autoscaling.
Azure Container Instances (ACI) is specifically for running containers in Azure.
	You give ACI a container image (your app + everything it needs)
	You specify CPU, memory, and environment
	Azure runs it without you having to manage servers or clusters




	3 separate processes running, one on each VM.
	
	They are independent: one VM crashing doesn’t stop the others.
	They are identical in behavior: same app code, same configuration.

		Together, they handle more users or requests than a single process could.


	You have a web app VMSS with 3 VMs.

Each VM runs a web server process.

Traffic is distributed by a load balancer:

VM1 handles some users

VM2 handles others

VM3 handles others



Each VM in a scale set is a separate machine.

Your app runs on all of them independently.

Each VM runs its own copy of the process, but all copies are identical in code and configuration.







A VM Scale Set can create one or many VMs

You define a minimum number of VMs to start with.
	Azure can automatically add more VMs if demand goes up (scale out).
	Azure can remove VMs if demand drops (scale in

What can you use to connect Azure resources, such as Azure SQL databases, to an Azure virtual network?
Service endpoints are used to expose Azure services to a virtual network, 
providing communication between the two. 
ExpressRoute is used to connect an on-premises network to Azure. 
NSGs allow you to configure inbound and outbound rules for virtual networks and virtual machines. 
Peering allows you to connect virtual networks together.


You can link virtual networks together by using virtual network peering.

VPN gateway?
connecting an on-premises datacenter to an Azure virtual network
A VPN gateway is a type of virtual network gateway. Azure VPN Gateway instances are deployed to a dedicated subnet of a virtual network. You can use them to connect on-premises datacenters to virtual networks through a Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN connection.
 

Service endpoints are used to expose Azure services to a virtual network, providing communication between the two. 
ExpressRoute is used to connect an on-premises network to Azure. 
NSGs allow you to configure inbound and outbound rules for virtual networks and virtual machines. 
Peering allows you to connect virtual networks together.

Site-to-Site VPN provides encrypted connectivity over the internet, 
while ExpressRoute provides a private (more secure), dedicated connection to Azure.
