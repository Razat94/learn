Cloud Service Types
-------------------

SaaS
	SaaS allows users to connect to and use cloud-based apps over the internet. 
	Common examples are email, calendaring, and Office tools, such as Office 365.

	You need to recommend a solution for Azure virtual machine deployments. The solution must enforce company standards on the virtual machines.


IaaS
	Virtual networks are part of the IaaS cloud service.
	Which cloud computing model best categorizes Azure VMs?
		- Azure VMs


PaaS	
	the cloud provider is responsible for the operating system, physical datacenter, physical hosts, and physical network. 
	In PaaS, the customer is responsible for accounts and identities.
	Answer: Azure App, Azure SQL & Cosmos are Platform 
	- Azure App Service
	- Azure SQL Database
	- Cosmos DB
	In a platform as a service (PaaS) model, which two components are the responsibility of the cloud service provider? 
	Each correct answer presents a complete solution.


	Q: Your organization is building a custom application.
	You need to focus on application development rather than configuration and management of servers.
	Which cloud service model should you use?
	A:	Application development


	Q. Which type of cloud service model is typically licensed through a monthly or annual subscription?
	A. SaaS




In PaaS, the cloud provider is responsible for the operating system, physical datacenter, physical hosts, and physical network. 
In PaaS, the customer is responsible for accounts and identities.

SaaS is usually a monthly or annual subscription

PaaS and IaaS use a consumption-based model, so you only pay for what you use.

Netflix






With PaaS, users can focus on application development because the cloud provider handles all the platform management. In SaaS, the cloud provider manages all aspects of the application environment, such as virtual machines, networking resources, data storage, and applications. IaaS is the closest service model to managing physical servers.

=== Describe Azure architecture and services (35–40%) ===

Azure VMs are managed via portal.azure.com
	Note: By default, azure vms can't communicate with one another.

	Virtual machines are software emulations of physical computers. They include a virtual processor, memory, storage, and networking resources. 
	Virtual machines host an operating system, and you can install and run software just like on a physical computer.
	Note: If VM Is stopped, you still get charged.

Geography = Country / legal boundary

Region = City

Availability Zone = Building

Datacenter = Floors/rooms inside the building

MUST MEMORIZE:
Geography ->	Regions -> Availability Zones -> Data Centers

	23. An availability Zone protects against datacenter level failures
	40. An availabilty set protects against VM Failures.


MEMORIZE:
	To manage Azure VMS using the Azure portal:

Event grid
	Event Grid sits in the middle, routing events between them


A file is uploaded to Azure Blob Storage
 -> Blob Storage publishes an event to Event Grid
 -> Event Grid sends the event to:
	- An Azure Function (to process the file)
	- A Logic App (to notify a user)

azure functions - automation at minimum expense
	great for hosting code as part of a services infrastructe
	great for runnings small, event driven or short-running scripts.

Azure Files = backend file server
		like a folder, but specifically for applications. 


Which two protocols can be used to access Azure file shares?
SMB & NFS








All Azure VMs have an OS disk

That OS disk is Azure Disk Storage

Without it, the VM cannot boot

Each VM has:

OS Disk → Windows or Linux (required)

Data Disks → optional, for apps/data

Both are Azure Disk Storage.

No disk = no VM.

Very simple example of conditional access

Employee signs in from the office → Allowed

Same employee signs in from a new country → Require MFA


how and if a user can sign in, based on certain conditions.


When someone tries to sign in, Azure can look at:

Who the user is (user/group)

What they’re trying to access (app/resource)

Where they’re signing in from (location)

What device they’re using

Risk level (suspicious sign-in or not)

---



Conditional Access can use signals to determine information about authentication attempts, 
and then determine whether to block access or require additional verifications, such as MFA.

What can you use to allow a user to manage all the resources in a resource group?
	Azure role-based access control (RBAC)

Resources can only be associated with a single subscription. 
Subscriptions may be grouped into management groups. 
[x] An account may be associated with multiple subscriptions.






You can deploy apps and data to regional datacenters around the globe, 
thereby ensuring that your customers always have the best performance in their region. This is referred to as geo-distribution.






Defense in Depth
- several layers of protection to prevent information from being accessed by unauthorized users

A defense in depth strategy uses a series of mechanisms to slow the advancement of an attack that aims to gain unauthorized access to data

 The principle of least privilege means restricting access to information to only the level that users need to perform their work. 


A DDoS attack attempts to overwhelm and exhaust an application's resources.

The perimeter layer is about protecting an organization's resources from network-based attacks. 



ARM Templates:
	used to describe the resources you want to use in a declarative JSON format.
	to define the resources you want to provision in a declarative JSON format?

Azure Monitor is a platform that collects metric and logging data, such as CPU percentages. The data can be used to trigger autoscaling.
Azure Container Instances (ACI) is specifically for running containers in Azure.
	You give ACI a container image (your app + everything it needs)
	You specify CPU, memory, and environment
	Azure runs it without you having to manage servers or clusters




	3 separate processes running, one on each VM.
	
	They are independent: one VM crashing doesn’t stop the others.
	They are identical in behavior: same app code, same configuration.

		Together, they handle more users or requests than a single process could.


	You have a web app VMSS with 3 VMs.

Each VM runs a web server process.

Traffic is distributed by a load balancer:

VM1 handles some users

VM2 handles others

VM3 handles others



Each VM in a scale set is a separate machine.

Your app runs on all of them independently.

Each VM runs its own copy of the process, but all copies are identical in code and configuration.







A VM Scale Set can create one or many VMs

You define a minimum number of VMs to start with.
	Azure can automatically add more VMs if demand goes up (scale out).
	Azure can remove VMs if demand drops (scale in
