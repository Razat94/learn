<p>
Cloud computing is the delivery of IT computing services over the internet, including but not limited to:
	- virtual machines, 
	- storage, 
	- databases, 
	- networking, 
	- and advanced services like IoT, machine learning, and AI.

All cloud providers provide compute and storage services.

<p>
<b>Cloud Models:</b>

[Source](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-cloud-compute/5-define-cloud-models)

* Public Cloud
	- Servers and storage are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider.
	- Services are offered over the internet and are available to anyone who wants to purchase them.''
		Think: Serverless Computing = Public Cloud

* Private Cloud
	- Servers are used by a single entity and may be hosted from your on site datacenter
	- Private cloud provides much greater control but at a higher cost.
</p>

<b>Benefits of Cloud Computing </b>

<p>
- Scalability is the ability to grow resources (up/out) for long-term, predictable demand, often requiring planning. 
- Elasticity is the automatic, real-time adjustment (up/down/in/out) of resources to match sudden, unpredictable workloads
	Elasticity = using more resources when you need them, and fewer when you don’t.
- High Availability -
	High availability ensures IT resources remain accessible <b>if</b> needed.
	When designing solutions, it is important to consider availability guarantees. In Azure, these guarantees are defined by service-level agreements (SLAs) that specify the uptime for each service.
	Think: 	High availability is about staying up & focuses on avoiding downtime.
- Fault Tolerance -
	Fault tolerance means the system can continue working even -<b>when</b>- parts of it fail. 
- Low Latency means fast response time. The lower the latency, the faster and smoother the user experience feels.
- Predicatability - Predictability in the cloud means being able to plan with confidence to avoid surprises. It applies to both cost and performance (e.g. an application behaves as expected in that it’s fast, stable, and handles load consistently).
</p>

<p>
- Vertical scaling means upgrading one server with more CPU or RAM.
- Horizontal scaling means adding more resources (e.g. servers) so that the traffic is shared among them.
	adding instances of resources such as virtual machines

<p>
* Capital expenditures are one-time expenses that can be deducted over time.  
	> MS Learn Definition: Capital Expenditures refers to upfront costs incurred one time, such as hardware purchases.
* Operational expenditures are billed as you use services and a do not have upfront costs.
